## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`do-art`](./do-art/) | Static visual content across 20+ formats - diagrams, mermaid, infographics, D3 dashboards, comics, icons, wallpaper - via Grok Imagine (xAI), GPT-Image-2 (OpenAI), and Nano Banana / Nano Banana Pro (Gemini). |
| [`do-illo`](./do-illo/) | Creates original editorial illustrations where a recurring mascot character performs the idea — one caught scene by default, a hand-built explainer diagram (labeled stages, a fan-out, timeline, loop, or stack) when the structure itself is the point, or a transparent character cutout (pose-only compositing asset, no scene or text) — in one of seventeen bundled looks (sixteen print, plus a photoreal toy-brick set). |
| [`do-show-me`](./do-show-me/) | Help the user understand the current topic visually with concise diagrams, code-shape sketches, and focused HTML artifacts. |
