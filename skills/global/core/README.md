# Core

Stack-agnostic foundations - review lenses, reasoning, testing, simplification, agent-legible repos, comments, design patterns, skill authoring, and AI-writing cleanup.

## Installation

These skills live in this repo (`edheltzel/agent-config`, being renamed GAP). `gap sync` installs every skill listed in `global/skills.json`.

```bash
gap sync
```

One skill by exact name:

```bash
npx skills add edheltzel/agent-config -s <skill-name>
```

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`do-adversarial-review`](./do-adversarial-review/) | Hunt a diff for correctness bugs and regressions, and report them without editing. |
| [`do-agent-docs`](./do-agent-docs/) | Make a repository legible to coding agents. |
| [`do-architecture-md`](./do-architecture-md/) | Generate an ARCHITECTURE.md file for a codebase following matklad's principles. |
| [`do-behavioral-testing`](./do-behavioral-testing/) | Behavioral testing methodology — test what users experience, not how code is structured. |
| [`do-code-comments`](./do-code-comments/) | Write high-signal code comments for humans and coding agents. |
| [`do-design-patterns-gof`](./do-design-patterns-gof/) | The 23 Gang of Four object-oriented design patterns (Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides, 1994) distilled as a practical field guide, not a catalog. |
| [`do-first-principles`](./do-first-principles/) | Physics-based reasoning framework (Musk methodology) that deconstructs a problem to irreducible fundamental truths, classifies every element as hard constraint, soft constraint, or assumption, then reconstructs the optimal solution from fundamentals alone. |
| [`do-humanize`](./do-humanize/) | Rewrite developer text so a sentence states a fact about this project, not a feeling. |
| [`do-redteam`](./do-redteam/) | Attack an idea, judge one named option against the evidence, or develop competing alternatives and synthesize a choice. |
| [`do-simplify`](./do-simplify/) | Simplify recently changed code for clarity, reuse, quality, and efficiency without changing behavior. |
| [`do-skill-craft`](./do-skill-craft/) | Authors Agent Skills: the vocabulary and principles that make a skill predictable, distillation of a blog post, article, documentation, GitHub repo, video transcript, book, or paper into a reusable skill, and review of PRs that add or modify Agent Skills for structural validity, design quality, and marketplace consistency. |
