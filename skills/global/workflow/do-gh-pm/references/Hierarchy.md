# Hierarchy — Epic → Feature → Task issue model

How to structure work as a three-level GitHub issue hierarchy and create issues correctly on a Projects v2 board. GraphQL is only for board-item field values. Sub-issues and dependencies use native `gh` flags (gh ≥ 2.94).

## The model

```
Phase Epic (parent issue)            e.g. #1 "Phase 1: Foundation"
  └─ Feature Issue (sub-issue)       e.g. #5 "Add user authentication"
       └─ Task Sub-issue (optional)  e.g. "Configure JWT refresh"
```

- **Phase Epic** — one per development phase. Holds the phase goal; progress bar auto-rolls-up from sub-issues.
- **Feature Issue** — one per distinct piece of work. Carries the user story, acceptance criteria (checkboxes), and a link to its plan file if the repo keeps plans.
- **Task Sub-issue** — optional, for larger features that want granular progress.

**Why sub-issues, not just labels:** sub-issues give automatic roll-up ("11/21 complete"), hierarchy in the board, and real parent/child structure. Labels only filter.

**Phase-less issues** are fine — bugs, polish, ad-hoc work need no Phase. Track them by Status alone.

## Issue creation checklist

Run every time an issue is created (by a command, an agent, or by hand).

### Pre-creation: dedup + parent lookup

```bash
# 1. Search for duplicates before creating
gh issue list --repo OWNER/REPO --state open --json number,title,labels --limit 200 \
  --jq '.[] | "#\(.number): \(.title)"'

# 2. If it belongs to an epic, confirm it isn't already a sub-issue there
gh api graphql -f query='query { repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
  issue(number: EPIC_NUM) { subIssues(first: 50) { nodes { number title } } } } }' \
  --jq '.data.repository.issue.subIssues.nodes[]'
```

### Always required

1. Create the issue (`gh issue create`).
2. Add it to the project board (`addProjectV2ItemById`).
3. Set **Status** (usually Backlog for new issues).
4. Set **Priority** — labels alone do NOT set board fields.

### When it belongs to a Phase/Epic

5. Set the **Phase** field.
6. Link it as a sub-issue of the epic — natively: create it with `gh issue create --parent EPIC#`, or link an existing issue with `gh issue edit EPIC# --add-sub-issue NEW#` (gh ≥ 2.94).

## Full recipe

Field/option IDs come from the reconcile lockfile written during ProjectSetup apply, or from `gh project field-list`. See `Labels.md` for which labels to apply (the canonical `:`-namespaced taxonomy — `type:*` for work kind; Priority and Phase are board fields, not labels).

```bash
# 1. Create issue (add `--parent EPIC#` to link it as a sub-issue in the same step)
ISSUE_URL=$(gh issue create --repo OWNER/REPO \
  --title "Feature title" \
  --label "type:feature" \
  --body "User story + acceptance criteria")

# 2. Resolve its node ID
ISSUE_NUM=$(echo "$ISSUE_URL" | grep -o '[0-9]*$')
ISSUE_ID=$(gh api graphql -f query='query { repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
  issue(number: '"$ISSUE_NUM"') { id } } }' --jq '.data.repository.issue.id')

# 3. Add to the board
ITEM_ID=$(gh api graphql -f query='mutation {
  addProjectV2ItemById(input: { projectId: "PROJECT_ID", contentId: "'"$ISSUE_ID"'" }) {
    item { id } } }' --jq '.data.addProjectV2ItemById.item.id')

# 4. Set Phase + Priority in one mutation
gh api graphql -f query='mutation {
  phase: updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue(input: { projectId: "PROJECT_ID", itemId: "'"$ITEM_ID"'",
    fieldId: "PHASE_FIELD_ID", value: { singleSelectOptionId: "PHASE_OPTION_ID" } }) { projectV2Item { id } }
  priority: updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue(input: { projectId: "PROJECT_ID", itemId: "'"$ITEM_ID"'",
    fieldId: "PRIORITY_FIELD_ID", value: { singleSelectOptionId: "PRIORITY_OPTION_ID" } }) { projectV2Item { id } }
}'

# 5. Link as sub-issue of the Phase Epic (if not already created with --parent)
gh issue edit EPIC_NUM --repo OWNER/REPO --add-sub-issue "$ISSUE_NUM"
```

## Dependencies (native, gh ≥ 2.94)

Model "blocked by" / "blocking" relationships with native issue dependencies — not a `blocked` label:

```bash
gh issue edit 123 --repo OWNER/REPO --add-blocked-by 200   # 123 is blocked by 200
gh issue edit 123 --repo OWNER/REPO --add-blocking 300,301 # 123 blocks 300 and 301
# remove with --remove-blocked-by / --remove-blocking
```

## Notes

- Sub-issues and dependencies are native `gh` flags as of v2.94 — no GraphQL `addSubIssue` workaround. Up to 8 nesting levels, 100 sub-issues per parent.
- If the repo keeps plan files, link the feature issue to its plan file, not the other way around.
- Keep the epic body's checklist in sync only if you aren't using sub-issues; with sub-issues the roll-up is automatic.
