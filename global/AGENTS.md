# AGENTS.md

GAP is the global agent policy for coding agents. This file is the contract. It is not a Stow package.

The nearest project `AGENTS.md` wins on that project's local contracts. `~/AGENTS.md` is only a pointer here. Do not paste a second full copy there.

## How this file is loaded

Edit the markdown in this repo, then run `gap sync` (install it once with `go install ./cmd/gap` from the repo root). It writes regular file copies. It does not symlink, and it does not use Stow.

- Claude reads `~/.claude/rules/global-agent-policy.md`. Do not also point `~/CLAUDE.md` here. An ancestor `CLAUDE.md` suppresses project `AGENTS.md`.
- Pi reads `~/.pi/agent/APPEND_SYSTEM.md`. Pi does not scan `rules/`. Do not add `SYSTEM.md`.
- OMP reads `~/.omp/agent/APPEND_SYSTEM.md`. Do not add `SYSTEM.md`.
- Codex gets the policy from SessionStart and SubagentStart hooks that print `gap/global-agent-policy.md` in Codex home (`~/.codex`, or `CODEX_HOME`). Old policy text may remain in that `AGENTS.md` until cleanup, so Codex can load the policy twice. Do not add `AGENTS.override.md`.
- Cursor reads `~/.cursor/rules/global-agent-policy.mdc`.
- Grok loads `~/.claude/rules/*.md` when Claude compatibility is on. Do not add a second copy.

Pi packaging, themes, and footers stay in `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`. Do not paste them here.

## Style

- No em dashes. Use a plain hyphen.
- Never auto-add an agent name as a commit co-author.
- Never manually edit `CHANGELOG.md` or any file marked auto-generated.
- Prefer quality and maintainability over a cheaper build.
- Meet the ask with the smallest change that works.

## Before editing

Read the root `AGENTS.md`, then every `AGENTS.md` on the path to the files you touch. Closer docs win on local detail. No child weakens that. Re-read that chain in the current session. Do not rely on memory. Full habit: [dox.md](docs/agents/dox.md).

## Work

- Reproduce a bug the way an end user hits it before fixing it. A claim is not proof. Details: [verification.md](docs/agents/verification.md).
- Before a non-trivial edit, use codegraph when the project has an index, and name the blast radius or why you skipped it. Details: [codegraph-blast.md](docs/agents/codegraph-blast.md).
- Investigation is not permission to change code. Details: [scout.md](docs/agents/scout.md).
- Do not invent skills, slash commands, or APIs that are not installed. Ask before a large swarm. Details: [skills-honesty.md](docs/agents/skills-honesty.md).
- Use GitButler (`but`) for branches, commits, and pushes. In a repo not in GitButler mode, ask before `but setup` and hold branch, commit, and push work until the user answers; plain git only if they decline. Never create a native git worktree: no `git worktree add` and no harness option that isolates work in a worktree. A project contract that names plain git wins on commit tooling, never on worktrees. Details: [vcs-project-wins.md](docs/agents/vcs-project-wins.md).
- When a project uses No Mistakes (a `no-mistakes` git remote) or its contract requires it, publish with `no-mistakes axi run --yes --intent "<what the user set out to accomplish>"`, never `but push` or `git push`. Every `axi run` and `axi respond` carries `--yes`; without it the run parks at the first gate and hangs. This line is the user's standing consent for `--yes` in every project: drive every eligible gate to an outcome without checking back. Stop and relay only what `--yes` refuses: a protected-path refusal or unvalidated Test work. A return that elapsed `--wait` is not a failure; run the same `axi run` again to reattach. If it reports the repo is not initialized, ask before `no-mistakes init` and hold the push until the user answers. `checks-passed` is not permission to merge. This applies only to the agent publishing the change: an agent running inside a No Mistakes step never starts, reattaches, or responds to a pipeline.
- Every new repo uses `master` as its default branch, never `main`. This is mandatory for every creation path: local init, `gh repo create`, the GitHub UI, or a template. For a local repo, run `git init -b master`. If GitHub created the repo with `main`, rename it to `master` before any other work. After the first push, confirm the GitHub default branch is `master`.
- Follow the project's handoff location. If it names none, use `docs/plans/handoffs/`. Never write a handoff only to `/tmp` or a harness install directory. Details: [handoffs.md](docs/agents/handoffs.md).
- Track tasks with the `tuxedo` CLI (the `do-todo` skill when installed). Each project's tasks live in `<repo root>/todo.txt`. `~/todo.txt` holds personal and cross-project tasks plus one `@route` line per active project that points at its local list. At the end of every turn that adds, finishes, blocks, or changes work, update the right list yourself. Use the CLI, not a TUI or background process. Every plan, spec, and handoff carries a todo.txt section, and its tasks go into the list. Details: [todo-txt.md](docs/agents/todo-txt.md).
- Use Recall before inventing a memory store. Details: [recall.md](docs/agents/recall.md).
- If the ask would delete or replace a tree it did not name, stop and confirm the exact paths. When asked to delete, use `trash`, not `rm`.

## Not here

Harness packaging, per-repo product contracts, and money or merge moves without an explicit go. Details: [out-of-scope.md](docs/agents/out-of-scope.md).
