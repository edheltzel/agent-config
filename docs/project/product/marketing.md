# Marketing

Quickstart:

This skill lives in this repo (`edheltzel/agent-config`, being renamed GAP) at `skills/project/product/do-marketing`. `global/skills.json` lists it with `"source": "."`. Install and refresh it with:

```bash
gap sync
```

One skill by exact name:

```bash
npx skills add edheltzel/agent-config -s do-marketing
```

## What it does

`do-marketing` turns what a product actually does into reasons to try it, paths
into it, and a way to measure whether that work learned anything. The defining
constraint is the **evidence ledger**: claims, launches, and reports come from
product code and authorized analytics, with inventing results forbidden.

An audit reports. An implementation changes assets. Neither one authorizes
spending, sending, publishing, or deployment.

## When to reach for it

Type `/do-marketing`, or the agent reaches for it automatically when a request
calls for a marketing audit, go-to-market path, claims register, launch plan,
measurement review, or a synchronized report, deck, or video.

Reach for it when the job is positioning, discovery, conversion, or retention
for an audience. For static visuals that accompany that work, use
[art](../../global/content/art.md) or [illo](../../global/content/illo.md). For reusable product UI, use
[design-system](../frontend/design-system.md).

## Evidence before copy

Start with a ledger: source, revision, audience, status (local / implemented /
published / observed / measured), and the exact claim the evidence supports.
Keep a claims register with wording, scope, as-of date, and expiry. Choose only
the GTM channels the brief warrants — owned content, search, agent discovery,
conversion, proof assets, distribution, lifecycle — then measure one qualified
activation before scaling a tactic.

If analytics access is missing, mark outcomes unmeasured and ship the
measurement plan. Do not invent lift.

## Where it fits

`do-marketing` is the Product group's go-to-market skill. `do-art` and
`do-illo` make the pictures; this skill decides what is true enough to say,
where it should live, and how you will know if it worked.
