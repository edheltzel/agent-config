# Skill Craft

Quickstart:

This skill lives in this repo (`edheltzel/agent-config`, being renamed GAP) at `skills/global/core/do-skill-craft`. `global/skills.json` lists it with `"source": "."`. Install and refresh it with:

```bash
gap sync
```

One skill by exact name:

```bash
npx skills add edheltzel/agent-config -s do-skill-craft
```

## What it does

Authors Agent Skills: write the file, distill a source into one, or review a skill change. Predictability is the bar: the same process every run, not the same output. A distilled skill is a decision tool, not a summary, and must still be usable if the source disappeared.

## When to reach for it

- **Invocation mode.** Type `/do-skill-craft`, or the agent reaches for it automatically when a task fits. Review mode runs only on explicit request: `/do-skill-craft review [output-path] [--base <branch>]`.
- **Trigger boundary.** Reach for this when you are writing or editing a skill, turning a URL, article, repo, transcript, or paper into a skill, or auditing a skill PR. For the repo agent map, use [agent-docs](./agent-docs.md). For commit, issue, and spec prose, use [tech-writing](../workflow/tech-writing.md). For correctness bugs in a code diff, use [adversarial-review](./adversarial-review.md).

## Predictability

That word is the bar for every mode.

- **write** (default). Choose invocation, front-load the description, place steps and reference on the information hierarchy, split only when the cut earns it, link neighbour skills by name, prune no-ops, and steer with leading words. Failure modes: premature completion, duplication, sediment, sprawl, no-op, negation.
- **distill**. Absorb the source, keep decision rules, cut motivation, invert to rule then example then anti-pattern, and compress. A 5,000-word article lands near 150-250 lines. If the skill is as long as the source, it is a summary.
- **review**. Explicit only. Structural and marketplace checks are high confidence; design checks are medium. Every finding is verified before it is reported. The verdict ignores minor and informational items.

## It's working if

- The description states what the skill enables and the phrases that should trigger it.
- A distilled skill is a fraction of the source, and an agent can act on it without the original.
- A review names file and line, states confidence, and does not start unless review mode was requested.

## Where it fits

A standalone harness skill for whenever the artifact is an Agent Skill (`SKILL.md`), not repo instructions or general prose. Write-mode principles are MIT (Matt Pocock). Review-mode checks are Apache-2.0 (Beagle).
